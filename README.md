This is the first iteration of the Individual Project for the course COMP3297. The input in this iteration only takes the location data, extracts the details from the repective url and store it in store the json data accordingly.

Limitations of Sprint 1 executable:
- It doesn't implement the category of the location (for the Patient i.e. patient's home or work location etc.)
- The date of the visit by the patient is also not mentioned in this iteration as this iteration specifically deals with the extracting location data
- The issue with this iteration is that there could be duplicity of cities as (duplicates are not checked)
- Another disadvantage with this iteration is that the location data is not able to track the patients as they are not connected (wil be implemented in the later iterations). So the locations are just a det of data stored in the database.
